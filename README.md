#Chaining Array Methods

##Setup

These commands are a helpful quick start. You may choose to ignore them completely and create your own directory structure. If you choose to use this recommendation, just copy the commands below and paste. It doesn't matter what directory you are currently in.

mkdir -p ~/workspace/exercises/spa/chaining && cd $_
touch index.html
touch chaining.js

###Instructions

Using one single line of JavaScript code, complete the following tasks on the array of integers below.

* Sort the numbers in descending order (10, 9, 8, 7, etc).
* Remove any integers greater than 19.
* Multiply each remaining number by 1.5 and then subtract 1.
* Then output (either in the DOM or the console) the sum of all the resulting numbers.

```var integers = [13, 25, 6, 3, 11, 2, 18, 7, 21, 1, 29, 20, 12, 8];```
